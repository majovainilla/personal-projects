## React Projects

### [Appointments App Repo](https://github.com/majovanilla/appointments-frontend)
[Live Version](https://appointments-majo-vanilla.netlify.app/

This was my final project in Microverse. The purpose was to create a full application using all the knowledge acquired during the course. I created the backend using Rails as an API, and the frontend using React. The app allows the user to check available tutors in their cities and schedule an appointment to have an online class. You can check the profile of the tutors and select one.

### [Pet Finder Repo](https://github.com/majovanilla/pet-adoption)
[Live Version](https://pet-finder-react.netlify.app/)

In this project I started working with API's. I looked for an interesting API to work and decided to try [this one](https://www.petfinder.com/user/developer-settings/) that helps you find a pet to adopt. The project is still in work, as it will turn into its own API to help local pet shelters in my country to reach a wider audience and find more responsible adopters to give pets a home.

### [Bookstore Repo](https://github.com/majovanilla/react-bookstore-manager)
[Live Version](https://react-bookstore-final.herokuapp.com/)

Another simple project that works as a personal library. A user can create books using a simple form and see all the books they have stored, the info about authors, page numbers and other details.

### [Calculator Repo](https://github.com/majovanilla/react-calculator)
[Live Version](https://react-calculator-heroku.herokuapp.com/)

This was my first project using React. It's a simple calculator that allows the user to perform the basic mathematical operations and display a result. In this case, I added the ability to compute chained operations.


## RoR Projects

### [Social Network Repo](https://gitlab.com/majovanilla/social-network/)
[Live Version](https://serene-basin-51287.herokuapp.com/)

In this collaborative project, we created an app with functionalities like Facebook. The challenge was to build the app from scratch, designing the architecture, thinking about the models and the associations between them. At the end, the app allows a user to create an account with their email or through Facebook authentication, they can add other users as friends, accept or delete requests, create posts, comments and likes.

### [Event Manager Repo](https://github.com/majovanilla/event-app)

This project was focused on creating a website were users could publish and attend events. The events are organized by date. We practiced the use of complex associations, allowing a user to be an attendee and also the creator of an event, attend multiple events and the posibility to invite other users.

### [Members Only App Repo](https://github.com/majovanilla/Members-Only)
[Live Version]( https://fierce-waters-99113.herokuapp.com/)

This project is a basic version of a blog where we played with authentication to show or hide some features to the users. The functionalities are: sign up, login, and creating posts. All users and visitors can see the posts, but only logged in users can see the author.
The app uses the bcrypt gem for authentication, which is made from scratch. It also stores cookies to remember the logged in users.
This project was one of the first I created using RoR and was a challenge, especially building the authentication process.

### [Blog Project Repo](https://github.com/majovanilla/static-page)

Project based on the Michael Hartls' Rails Tutorial. This was the first complete RoR project that I built.
Over time I've improved the backend and the frontend. I enjoyed working on it and was challenged by this project, being my first attempt at Rails.

## JavaScript Projects

### [Weather app Repo](https://github.com/majovanilla/weather-app)
[Live Version](https://majovanilla.github.io/weather-app/)

This was a very fun project to build. The goal was to practice making API calls to a remote service. In this case, I connected the app with the [Open Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) and used two different API calls, depending on the selected temperature units. Although not an efficient use of the API, it was a good exercise.

### [Restaurant Page Repo](https://github.com/majovanilla/restaurant-page)
[Live Version](https://majovanilla.github.io/restaurant-page/)

I love the design I chose for this project. It is elegant and classic and shows a restaurant website using dynamic tabs that render different content when you click them.
You could say it's another version of a one-page site.

### [Library Project Repo](https://github.com/majovanilla/js-library)
[Live Version](https://majovanilla.github.io/js-library/)

This project was all about learning how to create a functional app using only JS. I practiced more with manipulating the DOM. The most difficult aspects of this project were trying  to use JS as a backend language and changing the elements in the Local Storage.

### [To do List Repo](https://github.com/majovanilla/todo-list)
[Live Version](https://majovanilla.github.io/todo-list/)

This was a fun project. Again, the tricky thing is using Javascript to select and manipulate the actual objects stored in the DB, in this case Local Storage.
The app allows the user to create projects and attach to-dos to them, along with a description, priority, and due date. We also played a little with form validation using JS to avoid allowing incorrect inputs to be submitted.

## Ruby Projects

### [Tic Tac Toe Game Repo](https://github.com/majovanilla/tic-tac-toe-game)

A console version of the famous game, made with Ruby.
My partner @uryelah and I had a wonderful time creating this game with a very simple interface, like the old games we used to play in elementary school.
It's a two player game with the ability to keep the score.

### [Enumerable Methods Repo](https://github.com/majovanilla/enumerable-methods)

A sample of my own enumerable methods made with Ruby.
This project was really fun to build, and I learned a lot about working with enumerables, but also about thinking about multiple case scenarios and edge cases when working with methods.

## Front-end Projects

### [Youtube Page Repo](https://github.com/majovanilla/youtube-page)
[Live Version](https://majovanilla.github.io/youtube-page/)

The goal of this project was to get to know the HTML structure of a Youtube page and organize the elements of the webpage to ge the visual look that we wanted.
It was made using HTML and CSS.
The most interesting part of this project was embedding the video. 

### [HTML Forms Repo](https://github.com/majovanilla/html-forms)
[Live Version](https://majovanilla.github.io/html-forms/)

In this project we played with forms and inputs in order to get to know that essential part of HTML and then styled it with CSS.
We cloned an existing login website: https://mint.intuit.com/login.event

### [New York Times Clone Repo](https://github.com/majovanilla/new-york-times-clone)
[Live Version](https://majovanilla.github.io/new-york-times-clone/)

The goal of the project was to learn how to position elements and use the float property.
I had fun doing this project because I finally got to understand the relationship between position and display and how to combine them to achieve the look that I wanted.

### [TDN Clone Page Repo](https://github.com/majovanilla/responsive-design) 
[Live Version](https://majovanilla.github.io/responsive-design/)

In this project we created a responsive design website using media queries. We identified two different breakpoints to achieve this: one at 1024px and the other at 768px screen width.
Building this I got the chance to practice the use of float and flex (which is the one I like the most) to position objects and make them behave the way we wanted when changing the screen size.
