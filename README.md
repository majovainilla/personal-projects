# Personal Projects


## What are you going to find here?

A track of all my personal and collaborative projects with links to the public repositories.

I add a short description of each one of them and also a little context about why and when I made them.


### Youtube Page
https://majovainilla.github.io/youtube-page/

The first collaborative project I made as part of the Microverse Curriculum.
The goal was to get to know HTML structure of the Youtube page and organize the elements of the webpage to ge the visual look that we wanted.
It was made using HTML and CSS.
The most interesting part of this project was to embed the video.

### HTML forms
https://euqueme.github.io/html-forms/

The second collaborative project I made within the Microverse Curriculum.
We played with forms and inputs in order to get to know that essential part of HTML and then styled it with the CSS.
We cloned an existing login website: https://mint.intuit.com/login.event

### New York Times Page

The third collaborative project on the Microverse Curriculum.
The goal was to learn how to position elements and use the float property.
I had fun doing this project because I finally got to understand the relationship between position and display and how to combine them to achieve the look that I wanted.
