## Front-end Projects

### [Youtube Page](https://majovanilla.github.io/youtube-page/)

The goal of this project was to get to know HTML structure of the Youtube page and organize the elements of the webpage to ge the visual look that we wanted.
It was made using HTML and CSS.
The most interesting part of this project was to embed the video. 
Coding partner: <a href="https://github.com/euqueme">@euqueme</a>

### [HTML forms](https://euqueme.github.io/html-forms/)

In this project we played with forms and inputs in order to get to know that essential part of HTML and then styled it with the CSS.
We cloned an existing login website: https://mint.intuit.com/login.event

### [New York Times Clone Page](https://github.com/majovanilla/new-york-times-clone)

The goal of the project was to learn how to position elements and use the float property.
I had fun doing this project because I finally got to understand the relationship between position and display and how to combine them to achieve the look that I wanted.

### [TDN Clone Page](https://github.com/majovanilla/responsive-design)

In this project we created a responsive design website using media queries. We identified two different breakpoints to achieve this: one at 1024px and the other at 768px screen width.
Building this I got the chance to practice the use of float and flex (which is the one I like the most) to position objects and make them behave the way we wanted when changing the screen size.

## Javsscript Projects

### [Library Project](https://github.com/majovanilla/js-library)

This project was all about learning how to create a functional app using only JS. I practiced more about manipulating the DOM and the most difficult part was to try to use JS as a backend language and change the elements in the Local Storage.

### [To do List](https://github.com/majovanilla/todo-list)

This was a fun project. Again, the difficult thing is using Javascript to select and manipulate the actual objects stored in the DB, in this case Local Storage.
The app allows the user to create project and attach to-dos to them, with a descrption, priority and due date. 
We also played a little with form validation using JS to avoid incorrect inputs to be submitted.

### [Restaurant Page](https://github.com/majovanilla/restaurant-page)
I love the designed I chose for this project. It is elegant and classic and shows a restaurant website using dynamic tabs that render different content when you clicked them.
You could say it's another version of a one-page site.

## Ruby Projects

### [Tic Tac Toe Game](https://github.com/majovanilla/tic-tac-toe-game)

A console version of the famous game made with Ruby.
My partner @uryelah and I had a wonderful time creating this game with a very simple interface, like the old time games we used to play in elementary school.
It's a two player game with the ability to keep the score.

### [Enumerable Methods](https://github.com/majovanilla/enumerable-methods)

A sample of my own enumerable methods made with Ruby.
This project was really fun to build, and I learned a lot about working with enumerables, but also about thinking about multiple case scenarios and edge cases when working with methods.


## RoR Projects

### [Blog Project](https://github.com/majovanilla/static-page)

Project based on the Michael Hartls' Rails Tutorial. This was the first complete RoR project that I built.
Over the time I've improved the backend and the frontend.
I enjoyed and was challenged by this project, being my first approach to Rails. Of course, nothing topped the feeling of being able to build a fully functional app for the first time.

### [Members Only App](https://github.com/majovanilla/Members-Only)

This project is a basic version of a blog where we played with the login to show or hide some features to the users. The functionalities are: sign up, login, and creating posts. All users and visitors can see the posts, but only logged in users can see the author.
The app uses the bcrypt gem for authentication, which is made from scratch. It also stores cookies to remember the logged in users.
This project was one of the firsts I created using RoR and was a challenge, especially building the authentication process.
